# This workflow will build and upload packages to PyPI when a new release is created.
# It is based on the "standard" Github workflow and uses twine to do the upload.
# Read more about the Twine Github Action at https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish

# Note that a PYPI_API_TOKEN secret needs to be added to Github.
